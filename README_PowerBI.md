## Course Topics Covered
The following topics were explored and applied during this project:
- **Conditional Formatting**: Applied to highlight specific values and trends within data visualizations.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Used to create calculated columns and measures for in-depth data analysis.
- **Drill Down**: Implemented to allow users to explore data at different levels of granularity.
- **Illustrations**: Added visual elements to enhance data presentation.
- **Lists and Bins**: Created to categorize and group data points for better analysis.
- **Move Columns to Rows**: Demonstrated techniques to pivot data for different visualization perspectives.
- **Relationships**: Established and managed relationships between tables to ensure accurate data modeling and analysis.

## Project Objectives
- Utilize Power BIâ€™s features to create dynamic and interactive dashboards.
- Apply DAX formulas for calculated measures and complex data analysis.
- Implement conditional formatting to emphasize critical insights within the data.
- Explore data using drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.

## Details and Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations and data management techniques:
1. **Conditional Formatting**: Applied across different visuals to enhance data readability and highlight key metrics.
2. **DAX Calculations**: Examples include total sales, average values, and custom metrics.
3. **Drill-Down Visuals**: Interactive charts that allow users to dive into specific data categories.
4. **Data Modeling**: Establishment of relationships between tables to create a cohesive data model for analysis.

## Installation and Setup
To view and interact with the Power BI file:
1. Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer.
2. Download the `.pbix` file from this repository.
3. Open the file with Power BI Desktop to explore the visuals and analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate time-based filters for dynamic period analysis.
- Incorporate advanced DAX functions for more sophisticated calculations.
- Expand the dashboard with user-based filters to customize the view based on user roles.
